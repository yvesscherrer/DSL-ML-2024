# Baselines

The `classify_svm.py` script provides a baseline system. It uses tf-idf-weighted character-level and word-level n-gram features in a linear SVM classifier. The classifier follows a multi-class (but not multi-label!) setup with the following two options to transform the multi-label annotations:
- `atomic`: Label combinations are added as distinct atomic labels. For example, the English task would have three distinct labels `EN-GB`, `EN-US` and `EN-GB,EN-US`. This corresponds to the DSL-TL setup where the `EN` label is renamed `EN-GB,EN-US`. This setup produces multi-label annotations.
- `expand`: Training instances with several labels are duplicated, once with each label. For example, an instance labeled with `EN-GB,EN-US` would appear twice, once with the label `EN-GB` and once with the label `EN-US`. This setup produces only single-label annotations.

The baseline script is called as follows:

```
python3 classify_svm.py <TASK> <MODE>
```

where `<TASK>` is one of `BCMS, EN, ES, FR, PT` and `<MODE>` is one of `atomic, expand`. Note that both modes produce identical results for BCMS since the training data is single-labeled.

# Evaluation

The `evaluate.py` script is the official scoring script. It provides per-class F1-scores, weighted and macro-averaged F1-scores. It also provides the same scores for the subset of the evaluation set with multiple labels. Usage:

```
python3 evaluate.py systemfile goldfile
```
